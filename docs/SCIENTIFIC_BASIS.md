## Sugarcane Climate Physiology

### Optimal Growing Conditions

**Temperature Requirements**:
- **Optimal range**: 21-27°C for maximum photosynthesis (Inman-Bamber, 1994)
- **Growth inhibition**: >32°C reduces photosynthetic rate by 50% (Ebrahim et al., 1998)
- **Critical threshold**: >35°C causes cellular damage and growth cessation (Wahid et al., 2007)
- **Lower threshold**: <20°C slows growth significantly, extends maturation period

**Water Requirements**:
- **Total water need**: 1,500-2,500mm over growing season (12-18 months)
- **Critical period**: Grand growth phase (4-9 months) requires 800-1,200mm (FAO, 2012)
- **Drought tolerance**: Moderate; can survive dry periods but yield drops 25-50% (Inman-Bamber & Smith, 2005)
- **Waterlogging sensitivity**: Root damage occurs after 5-7 days of saturation (Glaz et al., 2004)

### Climate Sensitivity by Growth Stage

| Growth Stage | Duration | Temperature Sensitivity | Water Sensitivity | Critical Threshold |
|--------------|----------|------------------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| **Germination** | 0-1 month | High (25-30°C optimal) | Moderate | <15°C no germination |
| **Tillering** | 1-4 months | Moderate | High | Drought →fewer tillers |
| **Grand Growth** | 4-9 months | High | Very High | >35°C or drought = major yield loss |
| **Maturation** | 9-12 months | Low (cooler is better) | Low (dry is preferred) | Excess rain dilutes sucrose |
| **Harvest** | 12-18 months | Low | Very High | Flooding prevents harvest |

**Key Insight**: Mid-season (grand growth phase) determines final yield. Climate risks during this period have the highest impact.

## Climate Change Impacts on Sugarcane

### Temperature Effects

**Observed Impacts** (Brazilian studies):

1. **Marin et al. (2013)** - "Future climate projections for Brazilian sugarcane under RCP 8.5"
   - Simulated 15-25% yield reduction by 2050 in São Paulo state
   - Primary cause: Increased water stress and heat stress days
   - Most affected: Northern and western São Paulo regions

2. **Dias & Sentelhas (2018)** - "Sugarcane yield gap analysis in Brazil"
   - Current actual yield: 70-80 tons/ha
   - Climate-limited potential: 100-120 tons/ha
   - Climate change will reduce potential by 10-15% by 2050

**Physiological Mechanisms**:
- **Photosynthesis**: C4 plant (efficient), but declines sharply >32°C
- **Respiration**: Increases exponentially with temperature, consuming sugars
- **Water use**: Higher temperatures increase evapotranspiration, exacerbating drought
- **Phenology**: Faster development reduces biomass accumulation period

### Precipitation Variability

**Drought Impacts**:

1. **Inman-Bamber & Smith (2005)** - "Water relations in sugarcane"
   - 50% reduction in water supply → 40% yield loss
   - Sucrose content decreases under drought stress
   - Recovery takes 2-3 months even after rain returns

2. **Silva et al. (2014)** - "Sugarcane responses to drought in Brazil"
   - 2014 drought in São Paulo: 20-30% regional yield reduction
   - Economic losses: >$2 billion BRL
   - Some farms experienced total crop failure

**Excess Water Impacts**:

1. **Glaz et al. (2004)** - "Sugarcane growth and yield response to waterlogging"
   - 7 days waterlogging: 20% yield loss
   - 14 days: 40% yield loss  
   - Root damage irreversible after 10 days

2. **Brazilian field observations** (EMBRAPA):
   - Harvest delays due to flooding: Common in southern regions
   - Reduces sucrose content (more water in stalks)
   - Increases disease (root rot, red rot)

### Extreme Events

**Heat Waves**:
- **2014 heat event** (São Paulo): Temperatures >38°C for 7 consecutive days
- Impact: 15-20% yield loss in affected areas (Lobell & Burke, 2008 methodology)
- Mechanism: Leaf scorch, reduced photosynthesis, increased respiration

**Flooding**:
- **2019-2020 wet season** (Southern Brazil): 30% above-average rainfall
- Impact: Harvest delays of 2-3 months, 25% yield loss
- Economic: Spot sugar prices spiked 40% due to supply shortage

## Climate Projections for Brazil

### IPCC AR6 Regional Findings

**South America (SA continent)**:

1. **Temperature** (IPCC, 2021):
   - Historical trend (1960-2020): +0.8 to +1.0°C
   - **SSP5-8.5 projection (2041-2060)**: +1.5 to +2.5°C above 1995-2014
   - **Regional pattern**: Greater warming in interior, less on coast
   - **Uncertainty**: ±0.5°C across CMIP6 model ensemble

2. **Precipitation** (IPCC, 2021):
   - **Central-west Brazil**: -5 to -15% annual precipitation

   - **South Brazil** (Paraná): 0 to +5% (slight increase)
   - **Northeast Brazil**: -10 to -20% (severe drying trend)
   - **Uncertainty**: High (models disagree on magnitude)

3. **Extremes** (IPCC SREX, 2012; updated AR6):
   - Heat waves: +50 to +100% frequency
   - Droughts: +30% duration in central-west
   - Heavy rainfall events: +10 to +20% intensity (despite lower total)
   - Dry spell length: +10 to +20 days per year

### Brazilian-Specific Studies

**INPE (National Institute for Space Research)** Climate Scenarios:

1. **Marengo et al. (2020)** - "Climate Change in Brazil"
   - Amazon deforestation accelerates regional warming
   - São Paulo region: +2.0 to +3.5°C by 2070 (RCP8.5)
   - Rainfall: Highly uncertain, models range from -20% to +10%
   - Confidence: High for temperature, medium for precipitation

2. **PBMC (Brazilian Panel on Climate Change, 2014)**:
   - Agricultural impacts assessment
   - Sugarcane: Suitable area may shift 100-200km southward
   - Economic losses: R$2-7 billion annually by 2050
   - Adaptation essential: Irrigation, new varieties, management changes

## Natural Hazard Science

### Floods in Sugarcane Regions

**Flood Mechanisms**:
1. **River flooding**: Paraná, Tietê, Grande rivers overflow during wet season
2. **Flash floods**: Intense convective rainfall (50-100mm in 2-3 hours)
3. **Urban flooding**: Poor drainage in expanding agricultural towns

**Historical Analysis** (Tominaga et al., 2009):
- Major floods in São Paulo state: 1983, 1995, 2009, 2016, 2020
- Return period: ~7-10 years for significant events
- Trend: Increasing frequency, consistent with climate change projections

**Sugarcane Vulnerability**:
- **Direct damage**: Crop loss in flooded fields (total if >10 days)
- **Indirect**: Harvest delays, equipment damage, road access
- **Economic**: Insurance claims, replacement costs, lost revenue

### Drought Patterns

**Brazilian Drought Regimes**:

1. **ENSO influence** (El Niño-Southern Oscillation):
   - El Niño years: Drier central-west, wetter south
   - La Niña years: Wetter Amazon, drier northeast
   - Sugarcane belt: Moderate ENSO sensitivity

2. **Multi-year droughts** (Marengo et al., 2018):
   - 2012-2016: Most severe drought in southeastern Brazil in 80+ years
   - Reservoirs dropped to 10-20% capacity
   - Sugarcane irrigation demand exceeded supply

**Climate Change Impact on Drought**:
- **Attribution science** (Otto et al., 2015): 2014-2015 drought 2-3× more likely due to climate change
- **Future**: Frequency and intensity both increasing
- **Mechanism**: Higher temperatures = more evaporation, even if rainfall stable

### Wildfire Risk

**Fire in Brazilian Sugarcane**:

1. **Pre-harvest burning** (traditional):
   - Historically: 70-80% of sugarcane burned before harvest
   - **Current**: Declining (banned in many regions since 2010)
   - Purpose: Removes leaves, facilitates manual/mechanical harvest

2. **Uncontrolled fires**:
   - Dry season (June-September): High fire risk
   - Sources: Escaped agricultural fires, lightning, arson
   - **FIRMS data** (NASA): 500-2,000 fires/year in sugarcane regions

**Climate Change & Fire**:
- Longer dry seasons → extended fire risk period
- Higher temperatures → drier vegetation
- Projections: +20 to +50% fire weather days by 2050 (Nolan et al., 2020)

### Landslides

**Geomorphological Context**:
- São Paulo state: Varied topography, including Serra do Mar mountain range
- Landslide-prone: Steep slopes with saturated soils during heavy rain
- **Sugarcane impact**: Road access, not direct crop damage (cane on flatter areas)

**Climate Connection**:
- Triggered by intense rainfall (>100mm/day)
- Climate change → more intense rain events → more landslides
- **Projections**: +15 to +30% landslide frequency by 2050 (Gariano & Guzzetti, 2016)

- RCP 4.5: -5 to -15% yield by 2050
- RCP 8.5: -15 to -30% yield by 2050
- Geographic shift: Optimal zones move 100-200km southward
- Adaptation (irrigation): Reduces losses to -5 to -10%

## Uncertainty & Confidence

### Sources of Uncertainty

1. **Climate Model Uncertainty**:
   - CMIP6 models: ±20-30% spread in regional temperature projections
   - Precipitation: ±40-60% spread (low model agreement)
   - **Implication**: Risk estimates have inherent uncertainty

2. **Downscaling Uncertainty**:
   - Global models (100-200km) → Brazil regional scale (25km)
   - Statistical downscaling adds 10-15% uncertainty
   - Local microclimate not captured

3. **Crop Model Uncertainty**:
   - Parameter uncertainty (variety-specific traits)
   - Model structural uncertainty (simplifications)
   - CO₂ fertilization effect: Poorly quantified for sugarcane

4. **Scenario Uncertainty**:
   - Emissions depend on policy decisions
   - SSP5-8.5 vs SSP2-4.5: Factor of 2 difference in warming
   - Social-economic assumptions (population, technology)

### Confidence Levels

**IPCC Confidence Language** (applied to this tool):

| Aspect | Confidence | Basis |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Temperature increase direction | Very High | All models agree warming occurs |
| Temperature magnitude (Brazil) | High | Most models agree within ±0.5°C |
| Precipitation direction | Medium | Models disagree on sign of change |
| Precipitation magnitude | Low | High inter-model variability |
| Extreme event frequency increase | High | Physical understanding + observations |
| Specific location impacts | Medium | Extrapolation from regional data |
| Crop yield impacts direction | High | Consistent with field experiments |
| Yield impact magnitude | Medium | Limited by model uncertainty |

   - Heat-tolerant varieties: +10 to +15% yield under stress
   - Drought-tolerant: +20 to +30% yield under water limitation
   - Breeding timeline: 10-15 years from cross to commercial release

4. **Adjusted Planting Dates** (Marin et al., 2014):
   - Shifting planting by 2-4 weeks can avoid worst heat/drought
   - Effectiveness: +5 to +10% yield improvement
   - Limitations: Market timing, harvest equipment availability
